# Cookie Crunch

I completed the tutorial Cookie Crunch by Ray Wenderlich [See Here](https://www.raywenderlich.com/125311/make-game-like-candy-crush-spritekit-swift-part-1).

I want to make some additions to the code and I needed a place to document that so here we are.

**Built with Swift 3.1.1, Xcode 8.3.3 (June 2017)**

## TO DO
